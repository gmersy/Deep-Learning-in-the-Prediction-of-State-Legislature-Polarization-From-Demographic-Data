Abstract: 
The preventative cost of data collection makes frequently updating data impractical. Machine learning can estimate updated data without undertaking the cost of actually surveying large groups of people. Political polarization level predictions were made of state legislatures for the year 2017, using the results of the 2013-2016 Shor-McCarty data set. This was achieved by training and testing a neural network on Shor and McCartyâ€™s initial results, which was combined with public demographic data from the same years. The network was accurate when tested against portions of the 2013-2016 data set. Using a model and demographic data from 2017, we predicted the results of the Shor-McCarty data set as if it were reflective of that year. All data was available online, and the neural network itself was built upon open-source libraries Keras, Numpy, Pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. Using a neural network, we show that data can reveal the political polarization of state legislatures in America. In addition to this end result, this paper introduces a simplistic correlation-based algorithmic optimization method and suggests an appropriate baseline metric for the inclusion of features in deep learning models. When applied to the field of machine learning, this method, along with being easily accessible, can lead to more accurate predictions from the deep learning model. Overall, this process could be applied to other studies and estimates, and reproduction can be attained at the relatively low cost of adequate computing power.
